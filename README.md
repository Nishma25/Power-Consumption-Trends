## In this webpage, Temperature analysis of the data for the period, July-Dec 2019 is published.

### ActivePower(kW) vs Time:
 Average Active Power in kiloWatts is calculated and plotted against each hour for a day    in a selected month.

### Avg ActivePower(kW) vs Date:
 Average Active Power in kiloWatts is calculated on a day in a selected month.
        
### Avg ActivePower(kW) vs Day:
 Average Active Power in kiloWatts is calculated for a day in a week 

### Avg ActivePower(kW) and Avg Temperature: 
Average Active Power in kiloWatts is calculated on a day in a selected month along with the temperature respectively.

### Avg ActivePower(kW) and Avg Humidity:
Average Active Power in kiloWatts is calculated on a day in a selected month along with  the Humidity respectively.
      
### Energy consumption calculation:
 The energy in kWh per day  is equal to the Power in watts times number of usage hours t  per    day divided by 1000 watts per kW
